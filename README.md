## 📊 Analysis Highlights

Here are selected visualizations generated from the R Markdown report for Ford Focus 2005.

Data analysis focused on engine performance based on collected parameters such as power, torque, temperature, and pressure. The analysis included calculations, data evaluation methods, and graphical visualizations that provide results with benchmark values. Studies were conducted to determine how the engine performs under various operating conditions and what deviations from the expected results occurred.
